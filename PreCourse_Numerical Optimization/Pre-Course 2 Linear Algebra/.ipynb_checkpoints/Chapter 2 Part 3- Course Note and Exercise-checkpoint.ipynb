    "## Iterative methods - Jacobi's method\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our matrix system\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A\\boldsymbol{x}=\\boldsymbol{b} \\quad \\iff \\quad \\sum_{j=1}^nA_{ij}x_j=b_i,\\quad \\textrm{for}\\quad i=1,2,\\ldots, n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's rewrite this by pulling out the term involving $x_i$ (i.e. for each row $i$ pull out the diagonal from the summation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_{ii}x_i + \\sum_{\\substack{j=1\\\\ j\\ne i}}^nA_{ij}x_j=b_i,\\quad  i=1,2,\\ldots, n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then rearrange to come up with a formula for our unknown $x_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i = \\frac{1}{A_{ii}}\\left(b_i- \\sum_{\\substack{j=1\\\\ j\\ne i}}^nA_{ij}x_j\\right),\\quad  i=1,2,\\ldots, n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now of course for each individual $x_i$, all the other components of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ appearing on the RHS are also unknown and so this is an example of an implicit formula which doesn't help us directly, but does suggest the following iterative scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Starting from a guess at the solution $\\boldsymbol{x}^{(0)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "$$x_i^{(k)} = \\frac{1}{A_{ii}}\\left(b_i- \\sum_{\\substack{j=1\\\\ j\\ne i}}^nA_{ij}x_j^{(k-1)}\\right),\\quad  i=1,2,\\ldots, n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this iteration, for a fixed $k$, it does not matter in which order we perform the operations over $i$ as the right hand side only contains the entries of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ at the previous iteration [based on this system can you think of a possible way to improve this algorithm?]\n",
    "\n",
